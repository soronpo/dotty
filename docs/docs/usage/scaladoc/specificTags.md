# {{page.title}}

Scaladoc extends Markdown with additional features, such as linking
to API definitions. This can be used from within static documentation and blog
posts to provide blend-in content.

## Linking to API

Scaladoc allows linking to API documentation with Wiki-style links. Linking to
`scala.collection.immutable.List` is as simple as
`[[scala.collection.immutable.List]]`. For more information on the exact syntax, see [doc comment documentation](./docComments.html#definition-links).
